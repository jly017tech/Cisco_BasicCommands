<h1>Cisco Basic Commands</h1>

<p>In the Testlab, I learned how to use commands when changing IP address and ping other network devices.
I looked up each most common terminal commands use in Cisco and understand every each it's own purpose. 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>conf t: This allows to add Ip address, setup ethernet channel to the rotuer or the switch</li>
  <li>en: When setting up a router, have to enable terminal otherwise you can't configure IP address setting.</li>

</ul>

<p>I also learned using ? helps show a list of option available. For example, I enter sh v? and it gives me:
  vc-group, version, vlan-range, vlan-switch, vlans, vpdn, vtemplate, and vtp.
